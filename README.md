## Abstract
<p>In the sport Formula 1, an open-wheel motorsport series, there are 20 spots on the grid. Historically, the people included within the sport are non-latino White men, with little room for minority participants. In 2007, Lewis Hamilton competed in Formula 1 for the first time, becoming the first and only black man to compete within the sport. In addition, the sport has a limited number of Asian drivers, many of whom were Japanese and encouraged into the sport by engine manufacturers from Japan. As the sport has existed since 1950 as a series, this showcases how slow progress has occurred within the sport in terms of who is allowed into the sport as a whole. In the recent season of Formula 1, minority drivers make up 5 of the 20 drivers on the grid. While this makes up a fourth of the grid, it is only recently that Formula 1 has seen so many drivers of a minority group. Often, these drivers are critiqued more harshly by fans and commentators. As such, I wished to discover if there was a relationship between headlines about minorities and word choice necessary. </p>

<p>In my project, headlines will be analyzed to discover what words were often used in these headlines that depicted these minority drivers a certain way. The data was originally taken from Formula1.com and includes headlines that are about a driver solely. Any headlines involving more than one party, not including where another party is talking about the driver referenced, were removed from the set. In terms of approach, I cleaned the data and grouped them utilizing nltk. When there were issues in sorting, I further sorted these manually. From there I found the frequency of word appearance and found that this was not as conclusive as I would like. Due to this, I manually applied the affect of each word through 'positive', 'negative', and 'neutral' based on the context of the sport and the season. From there, this was counted and visualized in order to showcase how much of each category is used in the headlines. In analyzing these, I have discovered that the headlines are primarily neutral overall in wording, as the website they are pulled from is the official site for the sport. However, the headlines are more negative than positive when comparing these two sets. As such the tone within the words utilized are negative leaning to neutral, which is vital to understanding how these minority drivers are represented. Although this is simply one sport to be analyzed, there are implications about the progress being made within sport as a whole - primarily in journalism. Racial and ethnic minorities often make up a small number of the sports they participate within in elite sports, thus these negative leaning word choices have implications for how these minorities are represented as a whole. If they are too harshly critiqued, it sets a precedent for how they are treated within the sport and allow for further obstacles for them to join the sport. As such, the data and conclusions reached in this project are important to elaborate how sport, and more broadly society, progress in creating more diverse and inclusive environments moving forward.</p>

### Leading Question 

<p>How are minority drivers represented in Formula 1 headlines? Are the words used more positive or negative?</p>
